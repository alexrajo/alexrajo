Hello! I am a 20 year old CS student with way too many hobbies for their own good.

#### What am I doing right now?
Currently I am interested in learning about the process of developing and deploying a full stack application with the help of Docker. I feel like the process of learning is much more effective if I actively try doing what I set out to learn, which is why I am currently developing a full stack application I am planning on releasing.
